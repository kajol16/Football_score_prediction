# Football_score_prediction
Introduction to the project:
Football is a sport with a prominent presence in people lives, watching, playing, or betting on it is quite common. However, when thinking about betting, we clearly can see that football has an unpredictable nature, and no serious research is required to prove that. Premier league supporters had an unexpected champion in 2015/2016, and their chances of winning the title were one in five thousand.
The goal of this study is to evaluate prediction methods of football (Soccer) results (win, draw, loss) in the Brazilian Championships using machine learning models. The models were tested recursively, and the results were compared for accuracy.
